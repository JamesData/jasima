#summary Creating and running a simple experiment in source and XML format

= Running a simple experiment =

After setting up a project to use Jasima, source files can be added in the `src` directory, for example:
{{{
package tutorial;;

import jasima.core.experiment.Experiment;
import jasima.shopSim.models.holthausSimple2.HolthausSimple2Experiment;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Experiment e = new HolthausSimple2Experiment();
		e.runExperiment();
		e.printResults();
	}
}
}}}
Compile and run using:
{{{
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=tutorial.Main
}}}

== Using the Eclipse plugin ==

In Eclipse, the project can be run like any Java project.
The Jasima plugin automatically installed the Eclipse M2E plugin, so Eclipse will interact with Maven and run the project with the correct classpath which includes all Maven dependencies.

= Running an experiment in XML format =

Experiments can also be created from XML files instead of source code.
Because this format is intended to be used with the Eclipse plugin's graphical editor, creating those files by hand is not covered in this tutorial.

Serialized experiments can be run manually using the class `XmlExperimentRunner`, which does not require the Eclipse plugin.
For example:
{{{
	mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=jasima.core.util.XmlExperimentRunner -Dexec.args=xml_experiment.jasima
}}}

== Using the Eclipse plugin ==

Use File->New->Other and select Jasima Experiment to create an experiment in XML format anywhere in the project tree.
The default experiment type, `HolthausSimple2Experiment`, will work out of the box.
The XML file can be run using Run As->Jasima Simulation.
