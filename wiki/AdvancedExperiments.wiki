= MultipleReplicationExperiment =

`MultipleReplicationExperiment` is the most simple implementation of `AbstractMultiExperiment`, which can run any experiment a number of times using different random seeds and create statistics about each result.
Much like `ValueStat` is used to summarize results of many data points in one experiment, it is used by `AbstractMultiExperiment` to summarize the results of a number of runs of the same experiment.
If the result of a single run is already a `ValueStat` object, all parameters except for the mea value are discarded.
Results that are neither numeric or of type `ValueStat` result in a list of the results of each run.

== Creating a MultipleReplicationExperiment using the Eclipse plugin ==

Nested experiments should be created from outside to inside.
First, create a `MultipleReplicationExperiment` using the Jasima Experiment wizard.
Then, press the 'new' icon next to the `baseExperiment` property to create any experiment that should be run multiple times, for example `HolthausSimple2Experiment`.
The properties of the inner experiment can be edited while the `baseExperiment` property is expanded.
Properties belonging to the inner experiment can be recognized by the gray bar next to them.

It is also possible to assign an existing experiment to the `baseExperiment` property.
To do so, click on the `Load` icon and change the file filter to 'Jasima experiments'.
A copy of the experiment will be made, so changes in the original file are not visible in the outer experiment's file.

= FullFactorialExperiment =

`FullFactorialExperiment` is another implementation of `AbstractMultiExperiment`.
Instead of simply running an experiment a number of times, it can also vary one or more parameters between runs.
