#summary Getting started with jasima

= Introduction =

This tutorial covers installing Jasima through Maven and setting up and running a simple experiment.

= Installation =

The easiest way to install Jasima is using Maven, which automatically downloads and installs Jasima and all of its dependencies.  There is no need to manually install Jasima when building a Maven project that includes Jasima as a dependency.

== Manually building and installing Jasima ==

Jasima can either be downloaded as a source archive or checked out directly from the SVN server.

After obtaining the source code, Jasima can be installed using `mvn install` or an IDE.
This will run many tests cases which will take roughly ten minutes and can be skipped using the parameter `-Dmaven.test.skip=true`.
Likewise, adding `-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true` will skip Javadoc generation.
The following files will be created:
  * `target/apidoc/*` - API documentation (can be skipped)
  * `target/jasima-main-VERSION-javadic.jar` - compressed API documentation (can be skipped)
  * `target/classes/*` - compiled Jasima classes
  * `target/jasima-main-VERSION.jar` - compressed Jasima classes
  * `target/jasima-main-VERSION-sources.jar` - compressed source coode
  * `target/lib/*` - Jasima's external dependencies
The `install` target will also copy the generated JAR files to your local reposirory.
If that's not intended, use `mvn package` instead, which accepts the same parameters and will generate the same set of files.

Although the build in the local repository will be preferred over any remote repository, it is a good idea to edit the `pom.xml` and add a version postfix when making code changes.

= Installing the Eclipse plugin =

This tutorial assumes that you will use Eclipse and the Jasima Eclipse plugin.
Instructions on using Jasima without Eclipse can be found in WithoutEclipse.

To install the plugin, use Help->Install New Software to add http://... as an update site and install the Jasima feature.

= Using Jasima in a Maven project =

The plugin will add a wizard to create new Jasima projects.
It will automatically create a Java project with Maven enabled and a preconfigured `pom.xml` that includes Jasima as a dependency.
