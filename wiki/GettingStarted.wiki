#summary Getting started with jasima

= Introduction =

This page covers installing Jasima through Maven and setting up a simple experiment.

= Installation =

The easiest way to install Jasima is using Maven, which automatically downloads and installs Jasima and all of its dependencies.  There is no need to manually install Jasima when building a Maven project that includes Jasima as a dependency.

== Manually building and installing Jasima ==

Jasima can either be downloaded as a source archive or checked out directly from the SVN server.

After obtaining the source code, Jasima can be installed using `mvn install` or an IDE.
This will run many tests cases which will take roughly ten minutes.
Adding the parameter `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` results in a much faster build by skipping all tests, whereas `-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true` will skip Javadoc generation..
Besides compiling all source files, this will generate a source JAR file and a Javadoc JAR file and place them in your local Maven repository, as well as the `target` folder in the source tree.  If you do not wish to install Jasima in your local Maven repository, use `mvn package [-Dmaven.test.skip=true]`` instead, which will generate the same set of files.

Although the build in the local repository will be preferred over any remote repository, It is a good idea to edit the `pom.xml` and add a version postfix when making code changes.

= Using Jasima in a Maven project =

When inserted into the `pom.xml`, the following snippet will add Jasima as a dependency:
{{{
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jasima-rep</id>
		<url>http://www2.ips.biba.uni-bremen.de/~hil/maven2</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>jasima</groupId>
		<artifactId>jasima-main</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
}}}

The Jasima Eclipse plugin will automatically do that when creating a Jasima project.
