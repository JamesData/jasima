#summary Getting started with jasima

= Introduction =

This page covers installing Jasima through Maven and setting up a simple experiment.

= Installation =

The easiest way to install Jasima is using Maven, which automatically downloads and installs Jasima and all of its dependencies.  There is no need to manually install Jasima when building a Maven project that includes Jasima as a dependency.

When inserted into the `pom.xml`, the following snippet will add Jasima as a dependency:
{{{
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jasima-rep</id>
		<url>http://www2.ips.biba.uni-bremen.de/~hil/maven2</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>jasima</groupId>
		<artifactId>jasima-main</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
}}}

== Manually building and installing Jasima ==

# TODO download

After downloading or checkount out the source code, the project can simply be installed using `mvn install` or an IDE.  This will run many tests cases which will take roughly half an hour.  Running `mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true` results in a much faster build by skipping all tests.
