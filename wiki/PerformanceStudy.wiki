#summary Performance study of automatically designed dispatching rules.

= Motivation =

The purpose of this study is to provide a benchmark for the comparison of different approaches for the (automatic) generation of scheduling heuristics, and dispatching rules in particular. By making the test problems and the descriptions and/or Java classes of the best dispatching rules publicly available, we pursue to facilitate the reproducibility of results and increase the comparability of different methods for the design of scheduling heuristics.

= Benchmark Problems =

As benchmark problems, we adopt the dynamic job shop and flow shop problems, defined and used in

Research_ 116(1), pp. 156–170.

The dynamic nature of these problems presents a specific challenge for solution methods, which have to be able to quickly adapt a solution in response to unexpected changes. This ability is one of the main advantages of dispatching rules, and the problems are therefore particularly suitable for their evaluation. Moreover, job shop and flow shop problems belong to the most widely studied scheduling problems in the literature, and thus serve well as benchmarks in our view.

= Examined Dispatching Rules =

The set of dispatching rules tested in this study includes several dispatching rules generated by various automatic methods (also called hyper-heuristics), as well as a few manually developed rules that have proven to perform well for the benchmark problems. In particular, the
