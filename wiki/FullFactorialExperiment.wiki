#summary Running an experiment of the FullFactorialExperiment class.

= Running Multiple Replications with Varying Parameters =

Often, simulation studies are conducted to compare a number of different settings or designs for a given problem. If the comparisons only concerns a single parameter for which we want to test a limited number of values, this can be realised by manually setting up the experiment with a given candidate value, running the simulation experiment, and repeating these steps until all candidate values have been tested. However, if we want to test a larger number of values or are interested in different combinations of parameter values this quickly becomes a very tedious process. For this reason, the `FullFactorialExperiment` class offers a framework for automatically testing all combinations of a number of provided parameter values. The instructions in this section build on those in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
